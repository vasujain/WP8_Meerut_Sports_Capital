The Ashoka Pillar was carried to Delhi from Meerut, by Firuz Shah Tughluq. During the rule of Mughal Emperor, Akbar the Great (r. 1556–1605), there was a mint for copper coins here.</div><div><br /></div><div>Meerut is famously associated with the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British East India Company. The famous slogan ""Dilli Chalo"" was first raised here. Meerut cantonment is the place where the rebellion started when Hindu and Muslim soldiers were given rifle cartridges rumoured to have a coating made of animal fat. The bullet wrapping was to be opened by mouth before use, which affected the religious sensibilities of both Muslims and Hindus as the fat used was alleged to be derived from lard and tallow; cows are held sacred by Hindus and Muslims consider the pig unclean. Meerut soldiers set fire to the bungalows of the English.</div><div><br /></div><div>Meerut was also the venue of the controversial Meerut Conspiracy Case in March 1929, in which several trade unionists, including three Englishmen, were arrested for organising Indian-rail strike. This immediately caught attention back in England, inspired the 1932 play titled Meerut Prisoners highlighting the detrimental effects of colonisation and industrialisation.</div><div><br /></div><div>The last session of the Indian National Congress before Indian independence was held at Victoria Park in Meerut on 26 November 1946. It was in this session that the Constitution-making committee was constituted.</div>";
